### To Potential Cloners and Master-Zip Downloaders - Rev 1.1 is here! Easy to clone!
Instead of hundreds of smaller files, there are handful Mega.nz links to the Wordlists. Torrents in 1.2.
The repository is no longer more than 20GB! The file contents are now less than 70MB, but there are old versions that make it still large. Working on that presently.

# Probable Wordlists
Wordlists sorted by popularity originally created for password generation and testing

### Why slog through an encyclopedic, alphabetized wordlist when you can start with the words people are most likely to use?
#### Methodology - The Why and How

 While I was able to locate a few Password Wordlists that were sorted by popularity, the vast majority of lists, especially the larger lists, were sorted alphabetically. This seems like a major practicality flaw! If we assume that the most common password is "password," and we are performing a dictionary attack using an English dictionary, we are going to have to slog from "aardvark" through "passover" to get to "password." Now I don't know off the top of my head just how common "aardvark" is as a password - but we could be wasting a lot of time by not starting with the most common password on our list!

 I went to SecLists, Weakpass, and Hashes.org and downloaded nearly every single Wordlist containing real passwords I could find. These lists were huge, and I ended up with over 80 GB actual, human-generated and used passwords. These were split up among over 350 files of varying length, sorting scheme, character encoding, origin and other properties. I sorted these files, removed duplicates from within the files themselves, and prepared to join them all together.

 Some of these lists were composed of the other lists, and some were exact duplicates. I took care to remove any exact duplicate files - we didn't need to have any avoidable false positives. __*If a password was found across multiple files, I considered this to be an approximation of its popularity.*__ If an entry was found in 5 files, it wasn't too popular. If an entry could be found in 300 files, it was very popular. Using Unix commands, I concatenated all the files into one giant file representing keys to over 4 billion secret areas on the web, and sorted them by number of appearances in the single file. From this, I was able to create a large wordlist sorted by popularity, not the alphabet.

 
### Laser-Guided Wordlist Generator in the works as well - stay tuned
 

## Real-Passwords
These are **REAL** passwords. 
Every once in a while, a popular site has a high-profile security leak and passwords are released freely across the internet.
Some of these passwords can be found on aggregator sites where they are separated from usernames to protect the unfortunate victim.

The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/

*NOTE THAT UNTIL REV 2.0, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED*
 * A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

*NOTE THAT THE DUE TO THE NEWLINE DUPLICATES ISSUE, 'WPA-Length' LISTS MAY INCLUDE LINES OF 7 CHARACTERS*
 * This will be fixed in Rev 2.0


Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename


## Dictionary-Style Lists

Wordlists including dictionaries, encyclopedic lists and miscellaneous.


## Tasklist and Plans

### Rev 1.1 Task List
* [x] Explain methodology
* [x] Make Quick-fix for duplicates caused by newline and blankspace characters (not a full fix, more of a temporary patch)
* [x] Compress the Files(LZMA-Zip, tar.gz, tar.xz)
* [x] Removed huge files making the repo hard to clone.


### Rev 1.2 Task List
* [ ] Re-include Largest Wordlists in Repo (passwords appearing at least twice)
* [ ] Create and Add Torrents


### Rev 2.0 Plan
* Include truly acccurate WPA-Length sorting
* More sources (Contributions open, with strict terms. See Contributions page)
* Bigger sources
* Non-ASCII Sources
* Specialized lists compiled from sources themselves
* Totally Recompile wordlists for improved accuracy, no duplicates from the get-go.

### Undetermined Future Plans
* [x] Come up with poetic name for 'things that'd be cool that I'm not sure when I'll do'
* [ ] Create list of "pure" common passwords for use with rule-based cracking
