# What am I looking at?
Not torrents of these files, but you will be soon.

### Note that the Files in Rev 1.1 may include lines 7 characters long, due to the newline duplicate issue.
This will be fixed in Rev 2.0

##  THESE ARE THE PASSWORDS, all INTENDED to be WPA Length.  

  * The lines in this folder were intended to be at 8-10 characters long - until Rev 2.0 they may include 7-character lines.
  * Their length is in their title
  * A file containing passwords that appeared at least twice will be introduced along with torrents
  
 
 
##  LINK.txt Files
  * Until torrents come out in Rev 1.2 - the large wordlists will be stored here
  * Mega.nz Links to compressed formats of the files that were too large to store here
  * Mega.nz Links to the whole folder compreessed in various formats
  
      
   Recommended Unarchivers:
	Windows: 7Zip
	Mac: Keka
	Linux: Command Line, p7zip
  

  
These are **REAL** passwords. Every once in a while, a popular site has a high-profile security leak and passwords are released freely across the internet.
Some of these passwords can be found on aggregator sites where they are separated from usernames to protect the unfortunate victim.

The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/
I've taken nearly all of the real passwords from these sites, combined them into a single list, removed duplicates and sorted by popularity. I couldn't find many lists that weren't sorted alphabetically - it seems like a dictionary attack should reflect actual human behavior as opposed to the alphabet.

### NOTE THAT FOR THIS FIRST VERSION, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename
