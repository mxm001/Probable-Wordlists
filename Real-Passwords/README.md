# What am I looking at?
Not torrents of these files, but you will be soon.

##  THESE ARE THE PASSWORDS!  

  * Their length is in their title.
  * These have had duplicates removed since the initial release.
  * I generated files by the number of times each line appeared in my analysis. Files are available for 75, 50, 25, 10, and 5 appearances.
  * Top 196 - appeared at least 75 times - these are the MOST common passwords
  * Top 3575 - appeared at least 50 times
  * Top 95 Thousand - appeared at least 25 times
  * Top 32 Million - appeared at least 10 times
  * Top 258 Million - appeared at least 5 times
  * A file containing passwords that appeared at least twice will be introduced along with torrents
  

## WPA-Length Folder
  * This folder contains passwords at least 8 characters long, but less than 40 characters.
  * This is the format used by routers protected by WPA/2 security
  * _Note that until Rev 2.0, "WPA-Length" Wordlists may contain lines of 7 characters
 
##  LINK.txt Files (Do not contain WPA-Length)
  * Until torrents come out in Rev 1.2 - the large wordlists will be stored here
  * Mega.nz Links to compressed formats of the files that were too large to store here
  * Mega.nz Links to the whole folder compreessed in various formats
  
  Here are some links now:
   * [Compressions of Whole Folder](https://mega.nz/#F!kWJWFJSa!J2L8XL_u0Y423RPF2I2faA) 
   * [LZMA Compressions of all lists](https://mega.nz/#F!AfogCaSZ!BwHjFrb7VRr5brU71ufJpw)
   * [tar.gz Compressoins](https://mega.nz/#F!tSQ20bLJ!nYMydaxly8uMHm6lHBLePQ)
   * [tar.xz Compressions](https://mega.nz/#F!hPZx2K4D!7m9ssDI17HbZwcQvQq8zFA)
   * _The above links do not contain the WPA-Length Folder_

	Linux: Command Line, p7zip
  

  
## Real-Passwords
These are **REAL** passwords. 
Every once in a while, a popular site has a high-profile security leak and passwords are released freely across the internet.
Some of these passwords can be found on aggregator sites where they are separated from usernames to protect the unfortunate victim.

The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/

*NOTE THAT UNTIL REV 2.0, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED*
 * A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

*NOTE THAT THE DUE TO THE NEWLINE DUPLICATES ISSUE, 'WPA-Length' LISTS MAY INCLUDE LINES OF 7 CHARACTERS*
 * This will be fixed in Rev 2.0


Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename
