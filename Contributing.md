# CONTRIBUTIONS

## Sources
 The accuracy and success of this project is dependent on its depth. 
 It relies on having many, many, password files in order to find which are the most popular.
 However, this project will not accept just any source.
  
##### If your source contains any other information besides raw passwords - _*we don't want it.*_

We aren't trying to compile a list of people to hack - This is a list of passwords that are not attributable
to any particular individual for data. NO USER IDS, EMAILS, OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION BESIDES RAW PASSWORDS. FULL STOP.
    
    
##### If you harvested your source yourself through trickery, phishing, malware or unauthorized access - _*we don't want it.*_
    
This project, nor its author or contributors encourage credential theft for the purpose of improving this project (or any other purpose) While leaks do happen, we do not want any part in encouraging or perpetrating them.
    
    
### Desired Sources
  This project has its origins in the United States, and thus the English-speaking, Latin-Alphabet using Western World.
  
  The majority of people on Earth, however, are NOT English Speaking, Latin-Alphabet Westerners. 
  Since the aim of the project is find the WORLD'S most common passwords, not the West's most common passwords -
  we sure could use some sources in Chinese, Russian, Arabic, and any other languages that do not use the Latin alphabet.
  (We will likely create seperate lists based on languages as well - as there certainly are niches for non-English Wordlists)
